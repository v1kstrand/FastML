## 📌 Introduction

FastML is an Object-Oriented Python library designed to automate the end-to-end process of machine learning projects. It cleans your data, performs grid search on multiple models, and selects the best-performing model based on your data type (regression or classification). Developed with a strong focus on design patterns and SOLID principles, FastML aims to provide a robust, maintainable, and efficient way to handle ML projects.

### 🚀 Usage

#### Step 1: Configure User Input

Navigate to the `user_input` folder and open `user_input.txt` located there. Fill in the required fields to configure the machine learning task. Save the file.

#### Step 2: Run the Program

Execute the `main.py` module to start the FastML program. This will read the configuration from the input file and execute the machine learning tasks accordingly.

```bash
python FastML
```

#### Step 3: Retrieve the Best Model

After execution, the best-performing model will be saved in the `models` folder as a .joblib file.
